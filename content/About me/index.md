Hey! My name is SecurityAura and I've been working in Information Security for almost 10 years now. I'm a DFIR Consultant and therefore, active incident responder. I mainly deal with intrusion, data exfiltration, ransomware and Business Email Compromise (BEC) cases. I also assist our Microsoft Sentinel and SOC teams with advanced investigations and use cases development. The rest of my time is spent on Threat Hunting and Detection Engineering.

## Knowledge, Skills & Interest

As far as my knowledge and skills goes, I focus on:

- Microsoft Defender XDR
- Microsoft Sentinel
- EDRs (Carbon Black Cloud, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, MDE, etc.)
- Digital Forensics
- Incident Response
- Threat Hunting
- Detection Engineering
- Microsoft PowerShell (which I use for all my scripts)

Which are therefore all domains I'm interested in.

## Socials

I'm mostly active on Twitter, but I also have a BlueSky and Mastodon account on InfoSec.Exchange:

- Twitter (X): https://x.com/SecurityAura
- Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/securityaura.bsky.social
- Mastodon (InfoSec.Exchange): https://infosec.exchange/@SecurityAura

And I have a few repos, namely one dedicated to DE&TH (Detection Engineering and Threat Hunting) using the Microsoft Defender XDR and/or Microsoft Sentinel stack (read: KQL stuff), on Github:
